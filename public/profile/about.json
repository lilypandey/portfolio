    "about": " Hi, I’m Lily Pandey. I am a backend developer passionate about building scalable systems, solving challenging problems, and diving deep into how things work under the hood. I thrive on debugging tricky issues, optimizing system performance, and continuously learning new technologies to improve my craft.\n\n\nWith hands-on experience in backend architecture, system design, and real-time applications, I’ve developed and contributed to projects involving microservices, message queues, and distributed systems. I am proficient in C++, Java and Python and I enjoy working with tools like SpringBoot, MySQL, FastAPI, Kafka, Docker, and PostgreSQL, and I’m always exploring better ways to create efficient and reliable systems.\n\n\nOutside of tech, I love baking, cooking, cycling, and exploring criminal psychology. My curiosity fuels both my work and my hobbies, and I believe that passion and persistence are key to growth. ",
